TIC-TAC-TOE

This code results in a simple tic-tac-toe application implemented in C++.
The game includes two players, with one of them having 'cross' mark, and another one having 'circle' mark.
While playing it, when a players selects any valid number (1 through 9), that spot is replaced by the respective mark. If none of them wins or loses, "draw" message is printed on the screen.

The game starts with the interface prompting the first player to select the spot first.
